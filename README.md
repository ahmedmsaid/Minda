](https://www.udemy.com/course/api-course/learn/lecture/26889642#overview)

## What is git
```
If you have already used git commands and want to know what happens under the hood, see [MIT lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjqTHE0zok) and their [notes and cheatsheet](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/).
If not, I encourage to take [Pluralsight git path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/managing-source-code-with-git).
For Arabic, [Eng. Osama ELzero playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAw4eOj58MZPakHjaO3frVMF).
To demonstrate git's commands without the need of having actual projects use [git playgorund](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
